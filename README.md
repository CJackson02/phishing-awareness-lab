# Phishing Awareness Lab

This project is an interactive, web-based phishing simulation and training module designed for senior-level cybersecurity students. It provides hands-on exposure to realistic email threats and reinforces key principles through an embedded quiz and immediate feedback.



## Learning Objectives

- Identify key red flags in phishing emails
- Understand how attackers use spoofing, urgency, and deception
- Practice safe decision-making with realistic simulations
- Reinforce phishing concepts through targeted assessment

Features

- 6 simulated emails (4 legitimate, 2 phishing)
- Immediate feedback for each interaction (click/report)
- 10-question phishing quiz covering:
  - Red flags
  - Domain spoofing
  - Social engineering tactics
  - Incident response
- Final performance summary and replay option
